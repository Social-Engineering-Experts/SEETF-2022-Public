# Batnet 2 - Solution

**Author**: Mythiology

**Category**: OSINT

This challenge aims to test participants on webscraping scripts. As the challenge description has mentioned, batman has created a reddit account and has posted several things on servers like
```
reddit account : https://www.reddit.com/user/Potentiallyjobless/
r/Marvel
r/fishing
r/fishinggear
r/singapore (might remove this)
r/SGExams 
```

1. Using the previous challenges, we understand that batman does not really like his job so far, in singapore and enjoys fishing as a sport. 

2. Using a simple google search, there are reddit web crawler scripts to be found. One example will be ['this'](https://github.com/Watchful1/Sketchpad/blob/master/overlapCounter.py)

3. Simply just type in the duration of the search and the server names and you will get the result.
