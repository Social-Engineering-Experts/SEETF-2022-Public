## Description

"Master Wayne told me that ever since he got onto the Internet, he has become obsessed with using this website called 'Read It' or something along those lines! He said he frequently discusses his interests on 2 major and 2 other smaller 'Sub Read Its'?! What kind of name is that?!

I really need to get Master Dick and Damian to get Master Wayne to stop browsing this website - it's certainly not healthy for him! The problem though is that I heard he's now using a new username for this website. Can you help me find out what his username is?" ~ Alfred.

**Note:** This challenge requires information gained from doing Batnet 1. Also, major 'Sub Read Its' refer to those with at least 1 million members while smaller 'Sub Read Its' refer to those with at least 1 hundred thousand members. Alfred has already done some preliminary research and has concluded that 'askSingapore' and 'singapore' are not one of these 'Sub Read Its'.

Flag format is `SEE{username_in_lowercase}`.
