- Tiktok : https://www.tiktok.com/@1mn0tb4tm4m [Flag `_3y3_help_m3` is hidden in the profile]
- Github : https://github.com/1mn0tb4tm4m [Flag `_f1nd_0ut` is hidden in the initalisation of the brother eye repo]
- Discord : 1mn0tb4tm4m#0166 [Flag `_ab0ut_3very0ne}` is hidden in base64 in the profile of the Discord user]
