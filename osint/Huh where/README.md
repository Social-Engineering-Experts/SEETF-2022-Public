## Description

Bruce Wayne enjoys going for walks at park connectors and taking in the view of the Garden City. He recently stopped by this place which was nearby the trail he was on and took a picture before continuing on his walk.  

Can you find out where this picture was taken?  
Flag format is the name of the place exactly as shown on Google Maps with **no capital letters and no spaces**. Example would be `SEE{123sesamestreet}`.
