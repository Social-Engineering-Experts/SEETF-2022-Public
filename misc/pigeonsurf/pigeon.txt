I am rainbowpigeon and I use MarketSurf - that's because when I'm not browsing suspicious telegram groups and forums, I am trading on the stock market. Recently I find that Pigeon Corporation (PGENY) has been doing well due to my hard work advancing the credibility of the Pigeon Master Race. I find MarketSurf really useful in telling me that my massive pigeon liberation campaign has been paying off. Soon we will take over the world and not even superman can stop us MUAHAHAHAHAHA. The NEW WORLD ORDER of Pigeon Supremacy shall begin with compromising WAYYANG'S LAPTOP, which has the WAYYANG TERMINAL. That will allow me to DOMINATE the stock market and make pigeons great again HEHEH.
