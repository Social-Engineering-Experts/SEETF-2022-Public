## Description

Hey there, Fawl here, aside from making CTF challenges and spending too much time online, I'm working on social media sentiment analytics company for stock and cryptocurrencies, Marketsurf. We catch the canaries in the coal mine of public opinion, giving those interested in market movements a bird's eye view.
Recently, our sentiment analysis algorithm has been struggling - we've received reports that an exceptional amount of Tweets promoting our company have been found online. This isn't the work of our marketing department - something is fishy. 
We can't tell if these Tweets are red herrings, but our team is in the thick of incident response. Help us kill two birds with one stone - what does the Tweet mean?

## Difficulty
