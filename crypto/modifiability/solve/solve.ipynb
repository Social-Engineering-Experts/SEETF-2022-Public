    "# Solution for Modifiability\n",
    "\n",
    "_This challenge was inspired by TSJ CTF 2022's [Cipher Switching Service](https://github.com/maple3142/My-CTF-Challenges/tree/master/TSJ%20CTF%202022/Cipher%20Switching%20Service) where you had to swap between ElGamal and RSA, and I thought we could do a similar thing with AES modes._\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick here is that [the CFB segment size defaults to 8](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/cipher/classic.html#cfb-mode), so that if you CFB-decrypt a large array of `00`s, then everything after the first 16 bytes will just be a single byte repeated indefinitely. This repeated byte is in fact the first byte when you encrypt 16 `00`s into the block cipher. The value of this byte is unknown, so let's call it `g`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this in conjunction with OFB, which is basically a xorstream whose (1-indexed) `i`th block is simply the IV encrypted `i` times. Now, if we converted that array of `00`s from CFB to OFB, this would effectively give all values of the IV encrypted 2 or more times, XORed with this unknown byte `g`. But this is just a factor of 256 which we can easily brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only ingredient left is the single-encrypted IV, which means we need to send back the doubly-encrypted IV through CBC to decrypt it once. Thus, the plan of attack is as follows:\n",
    "1. Convert a long stream of `00`s from CFB to OFB (gives us a xorstream from the second block onwards, also XORed with `g`)\n",
    "2. For each value of `g`, get CBC to decrypt the triply-encrypted IV as well as the doubly-encrypted IV. The former tells us if we have the correct value of `g` (since we know the double-encrypted IV), while the latter will tell us the singly-encrypted IV. At the end of this we know `g` as well the entire OFB xorstream.\n",
    "3. Since we have a xorstream, we effectively know how to encrypt and decrypt OFB, so send the message in OFB to get the flag back in OFB."
