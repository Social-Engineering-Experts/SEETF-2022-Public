[Solution](solve/solve.ipynb)

## Description

I've been learning about RSA, but choosing random primes seems quite arbitrary. Using universal "nothing-up-my-sleeve" constants like pi and e should make it more secure, so that you can't get my flag.

## Difficulty

Medium

## Deployment

`docker-compose up -d`

## Distributed Files

- All files under `/distrib`
