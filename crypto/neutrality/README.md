**Category**: Crypto

[Solution](solve/solve.ipynb)

## Description

I've been learning about one-time pads, but they sometimes generate more 1 bits than 0 bits or vice-versa. I think this leaks some information, so it's better to ensure that the one-time pad is always neutral.

## Difficulty

Hard

## Deployment

NIL

## Distributed Files

- All files under `/distrib`
