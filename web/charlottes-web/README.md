## Description

We made a Chrome extension to improve web accessibility.
But Google keeps saying that we have "broad host permissions" so we can't list it on the web store?

**Installation instructions:**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn on "Developer mode"
3. Press "Load unpacked" and select the `vuln` directory

Please uninstall this extension after the CTF and do not use for regular browsing.

## Difficulty

Medium

## Deployment

`docker-compose up -d`
