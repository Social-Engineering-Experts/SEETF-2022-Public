    "|3| Modify value of `STACK[-3]` (pointed to by `STACK[-7]`), to subtract 8. This makes it point to `STACK[-2]` rather than `STACK[-1]`. | Poke byte (val-8) to arg12 |\n",
    "|4| Modify return address at `STACK[-2]` (now pointed to by `STACK[-3]`) from `0x12B7` to `0x12C3`. This is basically the `win()` function, but just past the initial `push rbp` so that the stack is 16-byte aligned. | Poke byte 0xC3 to arg20 |\n",
